## Introduction
Node runner by [@0xLatte](https://github.com/potaeisme) founded in early 2024, an emerging force in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validation services. Combining fresh perspectives with a deep-seated passion for blockchain technology, I'm uniquely positioned in the validator landscape.

As a newly established validator, I blend passion for blockchain with a commitment to learning and growth. Our team's dedication and energy enable us to quickly adapt to the ever-evolving blockchain ecosystem.

Currently, I'm honing our skills across various testnets, preparing for future mainnet participation. While I focus on refining our operations, our ultimate goal is to secure and support production networks. I'm committed to operational excellence, ensuring consistent performance and reliability in all environments. This forward-looking approach positions us as a trusted partner in the ongoing development and security of decentralized networks.
