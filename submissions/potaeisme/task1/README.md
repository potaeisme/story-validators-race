## Introduction
Hello, I’m Latte, a Computer Science graduate from Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi and the founder of Node runner by [@0xLatte](https://github.com/potaeisme) launched in early 2024. While I am new to the world of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validation, my background in technology combined with a strong passion for blockchain positions me well for this rapidly growing field.

As I embark on this journey, I’m channeling my academic knowledge into hands-on learning, focusing on mastering node operation. My approach is rooted in hard work, curiosity, and a commitment to continuous improvement. Together with my team, we’re gaining experience by working with various testnets to sharpen our skills, with the ultimate goal of participating in mainnet environments.

Though still in the early stages, I am dedicated to operational excellence, aiming to ensure reliability and security in all of our validation processes. This mindset not only drives my personal growth but also helps us prepare to become a trusted partner in the future of decentralized networks.
